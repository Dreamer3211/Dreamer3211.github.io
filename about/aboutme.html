    <div class="center-column body">
        <p class="back">
            Born in Tel Aviv, Israel and raised in South Africa, from a small age I found that I didn't neccessarily fit in with modern soceity. 
            Growing up I discovered my love and passion in the world of Science,specifically:Geolgy;Chemistry and Physics.
            Throughout my years in primary and high school, I never gave much thought of my future and sort of went with the flow of time 
            and spent most of my years being alienated from soceity. This however really did not bother me, as I was more than happy to read a book or learn something new that was not in the "prescribed curriculum".
            I finished High-School and obtained my Matric Cerificate.Starting my studies at the University of Pretoria...
            WHAT A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM... They tell you that the amount of work you study in a year at High-School is the equivalent of a weeks' worth of knowledge at University. I found that out the hard and painful process.
            My first year on campus was met with disappointment;failure and individuals who manipulated my way of thinking. 
            In general, I truly was a horrible student. As the years went by I grew more and more uneasy about my place in this
            world and eventually it came to the point that I had developed an excessive drinking habit which promted me to be admitted to psychiatric care. Truth be told, I am not ashamed to admit this. I will tell this story to the day that I retire.
            After my time in psychiatric care, I was fortunate to travel to Eastern Europe to relax and re-evaluate my life-choices. 
            It was only at the Wieliczka Salt Mines in Poland where I rediscovered my passion for Geology.
            In 2019, I decided to pursue a career as a Financial Advisor for an Insurance Company. 
            There, I realized the truth and the hardships of modern day soceity. The first few months were amazing... travelling to new places in South Africa, some that I haven't even heard of. My realization and ethical principles only kicked in when I was working in Weenen, KwaZulu Natal, where I saw the true struggle for survival from the individuals living around that area. That is when I decided to hang up my "Advisory shoes" and pursue new endeavours.
            In 2020, I was fortunate enough to be allowed to complete my degree... 
            However, the world changed with the pandemic known as COVID-19. Regardless of this I succesfully managed to finsih my degree and 
            graduated on the 31st of November 2020.
            In 2021, being unemployed and getting no responce to job applications, 
            I decided to pursue the one thing that I may actually be good at... i.e. Programming. 
            First I did a course in Python for Data Science and thought:"Maybe I can learn more". 
            Hence, I acquired new skills on web development and here I am. 
            Living and enjoying every single day of learning something new and useful for life and coding.
